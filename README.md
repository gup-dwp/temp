# DWP design patterns

These patterns for DWP services are based on the research and experience of the DWP design community. You should use them to build on the [GOV.UK design patterns](GOV.UK design patterns).

These are the recommended standards for DWP service design. You should use them even when live services (like Carer’s Allowance) don’t yet follow them.
